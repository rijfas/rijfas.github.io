                <p class="mt-4 text-md text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                    In this section, I share my thoughts on the current state of technology and development practices.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Are There So Many JavaScript Frameworks?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    The web development world is full of JavaScript frameworks—React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and so many
                    more. It’s almost like we’re constantly reinventing the wheel. But why? They all do similar things,
                    so why not just agree on one and focus on building the product? The truth is, users don’t care if
                    your app is built with React or Vue. They just care about whether the app works well and solves
                    their problems. So, does it make sense to keep adding new frameworks? Could we be spending our
                    energy improving the product itself, instead of jumping from one framework to another?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Do We Overthink the Development Process?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    In the developer community, there’s often so much talk about the "perfect" workflow. We obsess over
                    the best text editor, the most efficient keyboard setup, or the ideal development environment. While
                    optimizing your setup can make a difference, sometimes we get lost in perfecting the process and
                    forget about the most important thing: creating something that works. At the end of the day, it’s
                    not about how fast you can type or how sleek your workspace is. It’s about the product you create
                    and whether it helps people. So, why do we spend so much time on process instead of just getting
                    things done?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Do Beginners Rely Too Much on AI?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    With AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT, it’s tempting for beginners to let them do all the heavy
                    lifting—generating code or fixing errors. But here’s the thing: using AI to solve problems without
                    fully understanding the basics can be a trap. If you don’t understand why certain things work the
                    way they do, you’re not really learning. AI can be a helpful assistant, but it can’t replace the
                    need for foundational knowledge. So, as tempting as it is to let AI take over, isn’t it better to
                    learn the fundamentals first? It’s like having a toolbox—you need to know how each tool works before
                    you start using them.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">What’s the Point of Education if It Doesn’t Build Real
                    Skills?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    Education is supposed to prepare us for the real world, but in tech, it sometimes feels like we’re
                    learning things that don’t translate into actual skills. There’s a lot of focus on theory, but the
                    world moves so fast that if we don’t get practical, hands-on experience, we might find ourselves
                    falling behind. In tech, you learn by doing. So, if education doesn’t teach us how to actually solve
                    problems or build real projects, then what’s the point? We need an education system that focuses on
                    skills that directly apply to the jobs we’re training for.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Do We Ignore User Needs in Favor of New Features?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    As developers, it’s easy to get caught up in adding new features or implementing the latest trends.
                    But often, we forget about the most important part: the user. We can build something technically
                    impressive, but if it doesn’t solve a real problem for the user or isn’t easy to use, it won’t
                    matter. So, why do we sometimes prioritize shiny features over actually listening to what users
                    need? Shouldn’t our focus always be on creating value for them?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Do We Talk About Tech and Tools More Than Results?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    In the tech world, we often end up discussing the latest tools, frameworks, and tech stacks more
                    than the actual results we’re delivering. Sure, it’s fun to talk about new tools, but at the end of
                    the day, users don’t care about the tech you use—they care about the results you deliver. If a tool
                    or technology doesn’t help you build something that’s useful or impactful, does it really matter?
                    Shouldn’t we be focused more on solving problems than talking about the tech we use to solve them?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Are We So Focused on Perfect Code Instead of Working
                    Code?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    In the developer community, there’s a big emphasis on writing perfect, clean code. While that’s
                    important, there’s also value in getting something working first, even if it’s not perfect.
                    Perfectionism can be paralyzing, especially when you’re just starting out. Sometimes, it’s more
                    important to get something functional and then improve it. But why is there so much pressure to get
                    everything perfect from the start, rather than focusing on making progress and improving along the
                    way?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-white text-sm mt-4 italic">Why Do We Get Stuck in Our Comfort Zones?</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed italic text-sm">
                    As we grow in our careers, it’s easy to get comfortable with what we know. We stick to the same
                    technologies and the same workflows because they’re familiar. But the tech world is always evolving,
                    and the best way to keep growing is to step out of your comfort zone. So why do we resist change or
                    hesitate to try new things? Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs happen when we push ourselves into
                    the unknown. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s how we learn and grow.
