                    showcases a mix of both personal and professional work—some still in the works, but all driven by

                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                    My journey into the tech world began at a young age, back when my fascination with the sky was
                    almost as boundless as my curiosity. As a kid, I was utterly captivated by anything that could
                    fly—helicopters, airplanes, the works. By the time I was 8, I was certain I was going to be a pilot.
                    Fast forward a bit, and my dad gifted me a Samsung tablet, which completely blew my mind. The power
                    of technology in my hands was something I couldn’t comprehend. I quickly dove into aviation-themed
                    games, trying to replicate my dream of flying. That was when I stumbled upon Infinite Flight—a
                    flight simulator that was pretty advanced and had all kinds of liveries. But here’s the catch—it was
                    a paid app.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">

                    Being the problem-solver I was, I wasn’t about to let a little thing like payment stop me. I started
                    scouring the web for hacks to get the game for free, experimenting with third-party stores and
                    downloading cracked APKs. But no dice—license verification would always ruin the party. That’s when
                    I got my hands dirty with tools like Lucky Patcher and Freedom (the emulation wizard). Through trial
                    and error, I managed to bypass the payment gatekeeper, but in doing so, I accidentally unlocked a
                    whole new obsession: tech, cracking, and the art of reverse engineering.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">

                    This led me to Google ‘how to start programming’—a search that would shift the course of my life. I
                    found an eBook on Java programming, but honestly, I didn’t understand a single thing. Yet, as they
                    say, one door closes and another opens. I stumbled upon HTML, the foundation of the web, and I was
                    hooked. From there, I found an app called "Webmaster Lite" that allowed me to code HTML directly on
                    my Android device. That led to CSS, then JavaScript, and before I knew it, I was in the wild, vast
                    world of coding.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                    The real turning point came when I found a guy named Mike from Jiraffe Academy (sporting a NASA
                    shirt, no less). He introduced me to HTML basics, and later I picked up C programming. From there, I
                    went full throttle—experimenting with different languages, creating websites, and setting up local
                    servers to clone platforms like Facebook within my network. As I dove deeper into Linux and learned
                    about pentesting, I started setting up a pentesting toolkit on my mobile device. I demonstrated
                    exploits on my friends, which felt like magic, and began building my skills as a budding hacker.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                    2019 was a game-changer. Google released Flutter, and they were giving away a free course.
                    Naturally, I jumped in. I was astounded by the things I could build using Flutter and Dart. But,
                    alas, my 4GB RAM potato laptop couldn’t handle Android development, so frustration set in, and my
                    focus began to shift.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                    But then, the universe conspired in my favor. After I completed my +2, my mom gifted me a gaming
                    laptop—perfect for gaming (which I promptly did for a while). But once I had conquered every game
                    I’d wanted to play, I realized the gaming thrill was short-lived. I rekindled my Flutter obsession
                    and started building apps to solve problems in my everyday life. I shifted to React for
                    cross-platform development since publishing apps on Android and iOS was expensive at the time.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                    Soon after, I began doing freelance work for family and friends. My skill set had expanded to the
                    point where I could build practically anything for anyone, and I quickly gained recognition for my
                    versatility. The story has a lot more chapters, and while I’d love to keep writing, well… I think
                    I’ve reached my limit for today. There’s still so much more, but I’ll save that for another time.
